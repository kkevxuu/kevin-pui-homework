# FP4 - Final Project Writeup


# FP2 - Evaluation of the Final project


# FP1 - Proposal for Critique

Idea 1:
Three.JS focused interactive portfolio

Goal:
-3D elements are novel in web development, demonstrate my skills to employers alongside my other work
-Promotes engagement and curiosity
-Showcases my work in a better non-linear way, which I like
Features:
-A main navigation page that has a 3D CAD model that represents my work and is interactive
-Transition animations into each page
-Good UX while being bold & experimental 
Tools:
-Three.JS
-Solidworks or Blender for the CAD model
-Javascript/CSS/HTML
Concerns:
-Website must be operable on two browser sizes, and be accessible. How do I achieve this with three.JS?
-The formats Three.JS supports and the associated complexities

Idea 2: 
Animation focused interactive portfolio

Goal:
-Demonstrate my abilities by creating a website with animations that enhances the browsing experience, parallax scrolling
-Experiment with clicking & dragging, mouse tracking

Features:
-Navigation page as pannable animation that the user can either scroll, or use a more novel technique and “flip through”
-Unique cursor on content pages
Tools:
-libraries like GSAP, Motion One etc
-Javascript/CSS/HTML
Concerns:
-Accessibility and aspect ratios, especially on mobile. Do I have to build two websites?

Idea 3:
Generative tree loading/landing page

Goal:
-Create something that is intriguing to interact with, not necessarily relating to my portfolio
Features:
-A landing page to my portfolio that has the ability to generate a new tree structure on every refresh or when button is clicked
-The tree structure can be revealed slowly, like a fake loading screen
Tools:
-GSAP and MotionOne animations for the content pages
-Javascript/CSS/HTML
Concerns:
-I’ve never written generative code
-Making the tree aesthetic, wondering if it would work with Three.JS elements? Perhaps keep it 2D if too complex
