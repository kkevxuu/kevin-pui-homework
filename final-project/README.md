Idea 1:
Three.JS focused interactive portfolio

![IMG_1380](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e28101f9-3c6e-49dd-ad95-159ba65e9b33)

Goal:
-3D elements are novel in web development, demonstrate my skills to employers alongside my other work
-Promotes engagement and curiosity
-Showcases my work in a better non-linear way, which I like
Features:
-A main navigation page that has a 3D CAD model that represents my work and is interactive
-Transition animations into each page
-Good UX while being bold & experimental 
Tools:
-Three.JS
-Solidworks or Blender for the CAD model
-Javascript/CSS/HTML
Concerns:
-Website must be operable on two browser sizes, and be accessible. How do I achieve this with three.JS?
-The formats Three.JS supports and the associated complexities

Idea 2: 
Animation focused interactive portfolio

![IMG_1381](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a899da81-8db2-4507-9e48-f46cf247f1e8)

Goal:
-Demonstrate my abilities by creating a website with animations that enhances the browsing experience, parallax scrolling
-Experiment with clicking & dragging, mouse tracking

Features:
-Navigation page as pannable animation that the user can either scroll, or use a more novel technique and “flip through”
-Unique cursor on content pages
Tools:
-libraries like GSAP, Motion One etc
-Javascript/CSS/HTML
Concerns:
-Accessibility and aspect ratios, especially on mobile. Do I have to build two websites?

Idea 3:
Generative tree loading/landing page

![IMG_1382](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8abb7de-ef31-48d5-9913-9cebd18c324d)

Goal:
-Create something that is intriguing to interact with, not necessarily relating to my portfolio
Features:
-A landing page to my portfolio that has the ability to generate a new tree structure on every refresh or when button is clicked
-The tree structure can be revealed slowly, like a fake loading screen
Tools:
-GSAP and MotionOne animations for the content pages
-Javascript/CSS/HTML
Concerns:
-I’ve never written generative code
-Making the tree aesthetic, wondering if it would work with Three.JS elements? Perhaps keep it 2D if too complex
